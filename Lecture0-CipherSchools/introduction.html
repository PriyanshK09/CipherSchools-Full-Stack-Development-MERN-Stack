The MERN stack has become highly popular due to its powerful and efficient capabilities for building robust web applications.
MongoDB offers a flexible and scalable NoSQL database,Express.js is a fast and minimalist web framework for Node.js,
React.js is a versatile library for building user interfaces, and Node.js is a runtime environment for executing JavaScript on the server side.
Together, these technologies create a cohesive and modern development stack for dynamic and interactive web applications.
    
This course is designed to help us master the MERN stack from the ground up.
We'll cover topics such as setting up the development environment, working with databases, building RESTful APIs,
creating responsive user interfaces, and deploying applications to production servers.
