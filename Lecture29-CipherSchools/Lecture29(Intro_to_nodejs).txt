Introduction to Node.js:-
Node.js is an open-source and cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment. 
It is a popular tool for almost any kind of project!

Node.js runs the V8 JavaScript engine, the core of Google Chrome, outside of the browser. 
This allows Node.js to be very performant.

A Node.js app runs in a single process, without creating a new thread for every request. 
Node.js provides a set of asynchronous I/O primitives in its standard library that prevent 
JavaScript code from blocking and generally, libraries in Node.js are written using non-blocking 
paradigms, making blocking behavior the exception rather than the norm.
