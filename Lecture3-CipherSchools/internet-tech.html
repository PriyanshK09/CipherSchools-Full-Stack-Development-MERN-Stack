        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>This section provides an overview of internet technologies, covering the basics of both frontend and backend development, and how they work together to create dynamic and interactive web applications.</p>
        
        <h2>Frontend Development</h2>
        <p>Frontend development focuses on the visual and interactive aspects of a website. It involves creating the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) using technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Frontend developers ensure that the website is visually appealing and provides a smooth user experience.</p>
        
        <h2>Backend Development</h2>
        <p>Backend development involves working on the server side of web applications. It focuses on the logic, database interactions, user authentication, and server configuration. Technologies commonly used in backend development include Node.js, Express.js, and various databases like MongoDB and SQL.</p>
        
        <h2>How Frontend and Backend Work Together</h2>
        <p>The frontend and backend of a web application work together to create a seamless experience for the user. The frontend sends requests to the backend, which processes these requests, performs necessary operations such as database queries, and sends back responses. This interaction is typically facilitated through APIs (Application Programming Interfaces).</p>
        <p>For example, when a user submits a form on a website, the frontend captures the input data and sends it to the backend server. The backend processes the data, updates the database, and sends a response back to the frontend, which then updates the UI accordingly.</p>
        
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Understanding both frontend and backend development is crucial for creating full-stack web applications. The MERN stack is a powerful combination of technologies that covers both frontend and backend development, enabling developers to build comprehensive web applications from scratch.</p>
