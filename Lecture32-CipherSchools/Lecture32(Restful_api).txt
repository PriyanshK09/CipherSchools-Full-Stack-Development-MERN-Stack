What is RESTful API?

RESTful API is an interface that two computer systems use to exchange information 
securely over the internet. Most business applications have to communicate with other 
internal and third-party applications to perform various tasks. For example, to generate 
monthly payslips, your internal accounts system has to share data with your customer's
 banking system to automate invoicing and communicate with an internal timesheet application. 
 RESTful APIs support this information exchange because they follow secure, reliable, and 
 efficient software communication standards.
